# Photonautics

**The physics of interstellar human travel - and why information transmission is the only viable path.**

---

## The Core Insight

Physical interstellar travel is almost certainly impossible. Thermodynamics forbids it: accelerating a ship to 10% light speed generates 10,000× more heat than any structure can radiate. This isn't engineering - it's physics.

But **photonautics** - transmitting human consciousness as information and rebuilding at the destination - works within known physics.

## Summary

| Method | Verdict |
|--------|---------|
| Antimatter drive | IMPOSSIBLE (thermal) |
| Laser sail | IMPOSSIBLE (thermal) |
| Generation ship | EFFECTIVELY IMPOSSIBLE (no machine operates 1000 years; social collapse) |
| Warp/wormhole | ALMOST CERTAINLY IMPOSSIBLE (no evidence for required physics) |
| **Photonautics** | **POSSIBLY VIABLE** |

**Timeline to first photonaut at Proxima Centauri: ~1000-1500 years.**

## Key Terms

**Photonaut** - A person who travels as information at light speed, rebuilt at the destination. From Greek: φῶς (light) + ναύτης (sailor).

**Interstellar seeding** - The centuries-long process of building autonomous infrastructure at a destination star system before human transmission becomes possible.

## The Bottom Line

The stars are reachable - not by us, but by copies of us. Whether that counts as "us traveling" is philosophical. What matters: human consciousness can exist on other worlds.

That might be everything physics allows.
